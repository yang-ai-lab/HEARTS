**HEARTS (Health Reasoning over Time Series)** is a benchmark and evaluation framework for testing how well LLM agents reason over real-world health time-series data.

## 🔬 Overview

HEARTS goes beyond narrow forecasting and simple QA by evaluating **four hierarchical capabilities**:

- **Perception**: signal-level measurement and feature extraction
- **Inference**: event localization, physiological classification, and subject-level profiling
- **Generation**: forecasting, imputation, and cross-modal translation
- **Deduction**: temporal ordering and longitudinal trajectory analysis

## 🫀 Why HEARTS

Health time-series reasoning is hard because data vary dramatically across:

- **modality** (ECG, EEG, PPG, EMG, audio, eye tracking, CGM, etc.)
- **frequency** (daily aggregates to 48 kHz)
- **sequence length** (tens of points to 1M+)
- **time span** (seconds to years)

HEARTS is designed to evaluate this full range in a single unified setting.

---

## 🔍 Key findings

- LLMs underperform specialized time-series models on many health reasoning tasks. And performance on HEARTS is only weakly correlated with broad "general reasoning" indices.
- Models often rely on low-complexity heuristics (copying/interpolation/rule shortcuts) instead of deep temporal reasoning.
- Performance degrades with longer sequences and higher sampling frequencies, with a shared, model-agnostic difficulty ordering across domains and input modalities. 
- Models in the same family show similar performance patterns, suggesting scaling alone is not sufficient.
- The input format of time-series (text/image/raw file) mainly shifts absolute performance, while relative task difficulty remains consistent across formats.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Modular architecture**: experiments (`exp/`), agents (`agents/`), and shared utilities (`utils/`).
- **Diverse datasets**: supports multiple healthcare datasets (e.g., SHHS, Capture24, VitalDB, Bridge2AI Voice).
- **Task variety**: Perception, Inference, Generation, and Deduction tasks.
- **Agent flexibility**: built-in support for different agent architectures (e.g., CodeAct).
- **Model support**: interfaces for major LLM providers (OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Gemini, XAI).
- **Reproducibility**: "frozen" experiment execution on fixed test cases for consistent benchmarking.

## 🛠️ Installation

This project uses `uv` for dependency management.

Requirements: Python `>=3.11`.

### 1) Install `uv`

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2) Sync dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3) Configure model provider credentials

Create a `.env` file (API keys are read from environment variables).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and set at least one provider key (examples in `.env.example`).

---

## 🏃 Quickstart

The primary entry point for running fixed experiments is `run_exp_freeze.py`. It executes a set of pre-defined ("fixed") test cases to ensure reproducibility.

### Fixed test case layout

Provide a directory containing fixed test cases (pickles) laid out as:

Fixed test cases can be downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/yang-ai-lab/HEARTS (extract locally and point `--fix-test-cases-dir` to the extracted root).

```text
fix_test_cases_dir/{dataset}/{task}/{index}.pkl
```

### Run

```bash
uv run run_exp_freeze.py --fix-test-cases-dir /path/to/test_cases
```

Tip: use `--dry-run` to validate your setup without calling a model.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure an experiment using `config.yaml` and/or command-line arguments. The repository includes an example at `config.yaml.example`.

Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
dataset_name: cgmacros
task:
  name: cgm_stat_calculation
  params:
    example_param: value
num_test: 50
model_name: gpt-4.1-mini
agent:
  name: codeact
  params:
    verbose: true
fix_test_cases_dir: /path/to/fixed_cases  # can also be set via CLI
result_dir: results/
```

Common command-line overrides (these take precedence over `config.yaml`):

- `--task`: task name
- `--dataset-name`: dataset name
- `--num-test`: number of test cases to run
- `--model-name`: model identifier (e.g., `gpt-4.1`, `gemini-3-pro-preview`)
- `--result-dir`: directory to save results
- `--logs-dir`: directory to save agent logs
- `--n-jobs`: number of concurrent jobs (default: 2)
- `--dry-run`: run without calling the model

---

## 📊 Results and logs

Experiment results and agent execution logs are saved automatically.

Results:

- JSON files written to `result_dir` (default: `results/`)
- filename format: `{dataset}_{task}_{agent}_{timestamp}.json`
- each file contains per-test-case entries (e.g., `query_id`, `subject_id`, `GT`, `solution`) plus a final entry with computed `metrics` and the full `config`

Logs (agent state):

- pickles written to `logs/{task}/{query_id}.pkl`
- include conversation history, code execution, and intermediate state; useful for debugging and analysis
